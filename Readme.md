          ## Overview

This project implements a **multithreaded server** that can accept multiple client connections simultaneously. Each client request is handled in a separate thread (or via a thread‑pool) to avoid blocking other clients.

Typical use: simple chat, echo server, command server, etc.

        ## Features

-   Concurrent handling of multiple client connections
-   Clean shutdown handling (if implemented)
-   Logging of client connect/disconnect, errors
-   Configuration of port / thread pool size (if available)

## Architecture

        (Adjust according to your code)

-   `Server` class / module

    -   Opens a `ServerSocket` on a chosen port - Accepts incoming connections in a loop - For each accepted `Socket`, dispatches to a `ClientHandler` in a new thread - `ClientHandler` class / module - Reads from the socket input - Processes requests / commands - Writes responses - Handles socket close and cleanup - Optionally a **thread-pool** or **task queue** to limit number of simultaneous threads

              ## Getting Started

              ### Prerequisites

              - Java JDK (version X or above)
              - Maven (if project is Maven based)
              - Alternatively, appropriate compiler / runtime for your language

              ### Build

              If Java + Maven:

              ```bash
              mvn clean package
              ```

              That produces a JAR in `target/` (or as configured).

              If it is a plain Java project:

              ```bash
              javac -d out src/main/java/**/*.java
              ```

              ### Run

              Basic usage:

              ```bash
              java -jar target/multithreaded_server.jar <port> [<thread-pool-size>]
              ```

              Example:

              ```bash
              java -jar multithreaded_server.jar 8080 10
              ```

              Alternatively (if no jar):

              ```bash
              java -cp out server.ServerMain 8080
              ```

              Where `ServerMain` is the class containing `public static void main`.

              ## Usage / Endpoints

              Describe how a client interacts:

              - On connect: server greets or awaits client input
              - Commands / protocol supported (for example):
              - `ECHO <message>` → server returns the same message
              - `TIME` → returns server time
              - `QUIT` → closes connection
              - Example client using `telnet` or `nc`:

              ```bash
              telnet localhost 8080
              ECHO Hello server
              TIME
              QUIT
              ```

              ## Testing

              - You can open multiple `telnet` or `nc` clients and send messages concurrently
              - Unit tests (if any) for `ClientHandler` logic
              - Stress test by spawning many clients to validate thread handling and correctness

              ## Design Notes

              - Choose **thread-per-connection** vs **thread‑pool** model
              - Thread-per-connection is simpler but may overwhelm on many clients
              - Thread-pool caps resource usage
              - Use synchronized blocks or locks if you have shared state
              - Graceful shutdown: intercept `SIGINT` to close server socket and interrupt threads

              ## Known Issues / Future Work

              - Lack of upper bound on threads (if using thread-per-connection)
              - No authentication or encryption (no TLS)
              - No rate-limiting / protection against resource exhaustion
              - Add support for asynchronous I/O (NIO)
              - Add metrics / logging enhancement
